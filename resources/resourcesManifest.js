   Mills Maths Tools — Resources by Stage : MANIFEST
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU EDIT WHEN YOU ADD A RESOURCE.

   The landing page (resources/index.html) builds itself from this file.

   HOW TO ADD A RESOURCE
   ---------------------
   1. Drop the file into the matching folder, e.g.
        resources/stage-5/trigonometry/bearings-intro.pdf
   2. Find the topic below (search for its `slug`), find the right outcome
      inside `outcomes`, and add ONE object to that outcome's `resources` array:

        { title:"Bearings — intro deck", type:"pptx", file:"bearings-intro.pptx" }

      `file` is relative to the topic folder, so you only write the filename.

   3. git add -A && git commit -m "resources: add bearings deck" && git push

   RESOURCE FIELDS
   ---------------
     title  (required)  what shows on the card
     type   (required)  "pdf" | "pptx" | "docx" | "xlsx" | "link" | "video"
     file   (required unless type:"link")  filename inside the topic folder
     url    (only for type:"link")  full URL
     note   (optional)  one short line under the title
     year   (optional)  "Year 9" etc — shows as a small chip
     tags   (optional)  ["revision","worked examples"] — searchable

   NOTES
   -----
   * Outcome codes / statements are verbatim from the NSW Mathematics K–10
     Syllabus (2022), NESA. Stage 5 focus areas are COLLATED (Trigonometry A/B/C/D
     -> one "Trigonometry" topic) as requested; each outcome keeps its own
     Core / Path badge and pathway note.
   * `path` values: "Core", or "Path" with `pathway` giving NESA's note
     (Stn = Standard, Adv = Advanced, Ext = Extension).
   * Adding a resource with an outcome code that doesn't exist here is a no-op —
     the page only renders what's listed below.

     STAGE 3  (Years 5–6) — 21 outcomes across 20 focus areas
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     NESA splits each Stage 3 focus area into Part A and Part B (a Year 5 /
     Year 6 emphasis) — but BOTH parts carry the SAME outcomes. So the A/B pair
     is collated into one topic here, exactly as with Stage 5.
     K–6 has no Core / Path distinction, so Stage 3 outcomes carry no `path`
     field and the page renders no badge for them.
