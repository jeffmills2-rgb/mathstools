## 1. What this is
A hub-and-spoke website of interactive maths tools for NSW Years 7–10, built by a
NSW maths teacher. It now also has a **secure Student/Teacher Platform** and
**Mills Maths Adventure** (a 3D low-poly maths game), all live.

- **Live site:** https://www.millsmathstools.au (Netlify + custom domain)
- **GitHub repo (the website):** https://github.com/jeffmills2-rgb/mathstools (branch `main`)
- **Firebase project:** `mills-maths-tools` (Blaze plan)

## 2. TWO folders / two projects (important)
1. **`mathstools-main 2/` = THE WEBSITE** (what deploys). Plain static HTML +
   the portal + the *built* Adventure. It is a **git clone of the repo above**;
   Netlify auto-deploys `main` on every push (`netlify.toml` = `publish="."`,
   no build step).
2. **`Mills Maths Adventure/` = THE GAME SOURCE** (Vite + React + R3F + Zustand +
   MathLive). Not uploadable as-is — must be **built**. Also holds the **Cloud
   Functions** (`functions/`).

## 3. Deploy workflows
- **Website change** (HTML tool, quiz, homepage, portal): edit in
  `mathstools-main 2` → `git add -A && git commit -m "…" && git push`. Live in ~1 min.
- **Adventure change:** edit in `Mills Maths Adventure` → `npm run build` → copy
  `dist/.` into `mathstools-main 2/game-platforms/mills-maths-adventure/` → push
  the website. (`vite.config.js` has `base:"./"` so it works in that subfolder.)
- **Cloud Functions change:** edit `Mills Maths Adventure/functions/index.js` →
  `firebase deploy --only functions --project mills-maths-tools`.
- **Firestore rules:** deploy MANUALLY via Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
  (never from code). Current live rules = `firestore.golive.claims.rules` (kept in
  the website repo for reference).
- Rollback safety branch on GitHub: `backup/pre-portal-…`.

## 4. Security model (the core of the rebuild)
- **No anonymous auth, no client identity reads.** Everyone signs in via the
  **secure code exchange**: Cloud Functions `exchangeStudentCode` /
  `exchangeTeacherCode` validate a typed code server-side and mint a Firebase
  custom token with claims `{ role, studentCode | teacherCode, … }`; clients
  `signInWithCustomToken`.
- **`createStudentForTeacher`** (callable, teacher-authed) creates students
  server-side, stamped with the caller's own `teacherCode`.
- **Live Firestore rules are strict + claim-based:** a student reads only their
  own data; a teacher reads only their own class; results are create-only and
  scoped to the signed-in student; no client identity writes; no result
  edits/deletes; default deny. Identity is managed server-side only.
- **Never store typed student answers in Firebase.** The web API key is public by
  design. Games use a **different** Firebase project (`mmt-firebase-games`) and
  are out of scope for these rules.
- Functions region: **us-central1**. Test codes: student `8F6AYH`, teacher `MILLS0423`.

## 5. Website structure (`mathstools-main 2`)
```
index.html                         hub / homepage (nav links to portal + Adventure)
portal/                            THE PLATFORM
  student/index.html               Student Platform (own results/progress)
  teacher/index.html               Teacher Platform (class results, roster, Add-student)
  admin/index.html                 disabled page (admin via Firebase Console)
  shared/ firebaseConfig.js · codeExchangeClient.js · quizClient.js ·
          mmtToolRegistry.js · resultUtils.js · portalStyles.css
online-quizzes/ , interactive-tools/ , worksheet-creators/ , flip-cards/ , games/
assessment/exam-builder/
game-platforms/mills-maths-adventure/   the BUILT Adventure (index.html + assets/)
dashboards/                        OLD dashboards → now redirect stubs to /portal/*
firestore.golive.claims.rules      the live security rules (reference copy)
portal/PLACEMENT.md , portal/README.md   migration + structure notes
```
- **Tool registry** (`portal/shared/mmtToolRegistry.js`) declares which tools feed
  the platform — add/disable entries here; nothing else hardcodes a tool. Each
  entry's `achievementToolName` must match the EXACT `tool` string the quiz writes.
- All Firebase quizzes were migrated to the secure exchange (via `quizClient.js`
  or inline). The decimal-zoom rounding quiz was converted from a public
  leaderboard to a secure achievements quiz.

## 6. Mills Maths Adventure (game source repo)
- Vite + React + R3F. `src/` (game), `functions/` (Cloud Functions),
  `portal/` (a DEV copy used only by the automated checks — the **website**
  `portal/` is the deployed one).
- **Dev panel** shows only in `npm run dev` (hidden in the production build).
- Defaults: **Camera Lock ON, Quest HUD OFF**.
- **251 headless system checks** in `src/dev/systemChecks.js` — run via the babel
  parse-check + Node harness (set `package.json` `type:module` temporarily, shim
  localStorage/window/document, run `runSystemChecks()`; restore package.json).
  esbuild can't run in that harness (platform mismatch) — don't rely on it.
- Cloud save: completed attempts write a compact `achievements` record + a rich
  `adventureAttempts` record (no typed answers). Demo/skip stays local-only.
  Curriculum/adapters/diagram systems are isolated — only adapters touch legacy banks.

## 7. Working agreement with Claude
- **Test before deploying** where practical: website pages via a local server
  (`python3 -m http.server` from `mathstools-main 2`, open the page); bigger
  changes via a branch + Netlify deploy preview.
- Keep the secure-exchange model; never re-open anonymous writes or client
  identity writes; never store typed answers; don't weaken the live rules without
  a clear reason.
- Match existing design tokens / folder casing (lowercase-hyphenated).
- When a change spans both repos (e.g. a teacher feature + a function), deploy the
  **function first**, then push the website.

## 8. Open / future items
- Teacher portal: revisit **graphs** (engagement/leaderboard — removed for now),
  add student **enable/disable/edit** + a class-management view.
- Functions runtime: bump **Node 20 → 22** before Oct 2026 (Google deprecation).
- Consider **App Check**; consider consolidating the 3 Firebase projects later.
- Old pre-reorg URLs (e.g. `/factor-circles/`) now 404 — add redirects if any were
  widely shared.
