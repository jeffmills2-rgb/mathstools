/**
 * MMT TOOL REGISTRY (Phase 4A) — the single place that declares which tools /
 * quizzes feed results into the platform. Add or disable entries here to control
 * what the Student + Teacher platforms surface; nothing else should hardcode a
 * single tool. PURE data + helpers (no Firebase / DOM), so the app's system
 * checks can import it directly.
 *
 * Field meanings:
 *   toolId                 stable id used in filters / dedupe
 *   title                  display name
 *   category               grouping ("Adventure", "Quiz", ...)
 *   enabled                show in the platform (false = hidden but kept)
 *   resultCollection       compact records collection (always "achievements")
 *   richCollection         rich per-attempt collection, or null
 *   achievementToolName    the `tool` value this writes into achievements
 *   topics                 topic ids/names this tool covers
 *   stage                  NSW stage label
 *   launchUrl              where to play/open the tool
 *   supportsAdventureAttempts  writes rich adventureAttempts?
 *   supportsSkillBreakdown     per-question/skill detail available?
 *   notes                  free text
