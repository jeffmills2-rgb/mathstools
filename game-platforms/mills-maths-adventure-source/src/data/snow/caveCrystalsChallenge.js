/**
 * THE ICE CAVE — LIGHT THE CRYSTALS (IC) — pure logic for the
 * THINK-ADDITION challenge, the eighth Snowball Sums build. No React, no
 * stores — fully checkable headlessly. All values are small integers.
 *
 * PEDAGOGY — subtraction is NOT always take-away: the cave wall carries
 * numbered crystals, and 52 − 47 lights UP from 47 to 52 — five glows,
 * done — while 52 − 3 lights BACK three from 52 and lands on the answer.
 * The CHOICE is the whole first act: count up, or count back? Up wins when
 * the numbers are CLOSE (the gap is tiny); back wins when you're only
 * taking a tiny bit away. The answer is read TWO different ways — count-up:
 * the answer is HOW MANY glows; count-back: the answer is WHERE you land —
 * and both are a − b, which is the deep point.
 *
 * A SET is 15 rounds, 3 per concept stage:
 *   S1  close numbers        count UP wins (52 − 47)
 *   S2  tiny take-aways      count BACK wins (52 − 3)
 *   S3  you choose           mixed
 *   S4  bigger + crossings   mixed, minuends to 97, hops cross decades
 *   S5  the long way round   7–9 steps either way — commit! (round 13 is
 *                            always a LONG count-back)
 *
 * Scoring (per round, max 25):
 *   A) CHOOSE the direction (fewer glows wins)  = 10
 *   B) TYPE the answer off the lit crystals     = 15
