/**
 * PENGUIN COLONY — PAIR THE PENGUINS (PC) — pure logic for the DOUBLES &
 * NEAR-DOUBLES challenge, the seventh Snowball Sums build. No React, no
 * stores — fully checkable headlessly. All values are small integers.
 *
 * PEDAGOGY — near-doubles as PAIRING: two rows of penguins waddle together
 * and pair off. 7 + 8 pairs up with ONE penguin left sticking out — so the
 * hidden double shows itself: double 7 and 1 more (or double 8 less 1 —
 * both are true, and BOTH score). The prediction comes BEFORE the pairing:
 * "which double is hiding in 7 + 8?" Exact doubles (7 + 7) pair perfectly.
 * The last stage plants the loveliest trick in the book: a DIFFERENCE OF
 * TWO (7 + 9) — one penguin waddles across and it's 8 + 8: DOUBLE THE
 * MIDDLE (levelling's little sibling). Grows to 25 + 26 and 35 + 36, where
 * near-doubling beats counting cold.
 *
 * A SET is 15 rounds, 3 per concept stage:
 *   S1  little near-doubles   4+5 … 9+10 (diff 1)
 *   S2  know your doubles     exact doubles 6+6 … 12+12
 *   S3  teen near-doubles     12+13 … 17+18
 *   S4  big near-doubles      24+25 … 38+39
 *   S5  the middle double     mixed — round 13 is ALWAYS a diff-2 pair
 *
 * Scoring (per round, max 25):
 *   A) PREDICT the hiding double (any TRUE form scores)  = 10
 *   B) TYPE the total after the pairs light up           = 15
